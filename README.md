Project: Debugging and Automation with AI

Overview

Welcome to a specialized module of out IT curriculim where we explore
innovative ways to integrate artificial intelligence into everyday coding
practices.This project is designed to enhance your understanding of 
debbugging
and automation in sodftware development using AI, specifically leveraging
ChatGPT as key tool. By engaging with these tasks, you will learn how to
effectively use AI to identify, correct, and prevetn common coding errors while
automating repetitive coding tasks.


Objectives
1.
Debugging:

Develop practical skills in identifying and resolving coding errors using
AI.

[200~Utilize ChatGPT to analyze code snippets across multiple programming languages, diagnosing bugs and proposing fixes.

Enhance your problem-solving skills by systematically approaching coding issues and implementing AI-driven solutions.

Automation:

Learn how to automate mundane and repetitive coding tasks with ChatGPT.

Generate boilerplate code, documentation, and basic unit tests to streamline development processes.

Focus on structuring code for maintainability and error-free execution using AI assistance.

Expected Outcomes

Enhanced Debugging Skills: Develop confidence in identifying and resolving bugs through structured problem analysis and AI-guided troubleshooting.

Automation Proficiency: Gain proficiency in utilizing AI to automate routine coding tasks, improving productivity and code quality.

AI Integration in Development: Acquire practical experience in integrating AI into traditional coding workflows, preparing you for emerging industry standards.

Technologies Used

Python (with tkinter for GUI-based applications)

Shell Scripting

ChatGPT (AI-based debugging and automation support)

How to Use

Setup the Environment:

Ensure Python is installed on your system (python3 --version).

Clone the repository to your local machine.

Run the Programs:

Execute individual Python scripts using:

python3 script_name.py

Interact with the AI:

Provide code snippets or debugging scenarios to ChatGPT for analysis and suggested fixes.

Best Practices and Recommendations

Regularly verify AI-generated code to ensure accuracy and adherence to project requirements.

Continuously test code after each AI-generated modification to confirm functionality.

Document all changes and keep a log of AI-driven recommendations for reference.
